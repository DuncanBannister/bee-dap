Cardano dApp for storing honey processing information

## Objectives ( Brain Dump) 

The objective of this dApp is to use NFT's to store information for batch's of processed honey so that consumers are able to verify the origin and quality of the honey they are consuming. 

### Why NFT?



This application will not be used to store all the data of the process but I think, a hashed set of data against a batch of honey. 

Another application will be built for inputing, storing and processing the data which will be used by the farmers of the honey. 


I think that I can create a token for each batch of honey, which will have a subset of data, pertaining the 'life-cycle' of the specific batch being shipped or processed.
